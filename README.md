## What is Ambience Designer?

Ambience Designer is an interactive web application that allows users to experiment with
combinations of sounds to create soundscapes, or “ambiences” directly in the browser. With a
focus on mental well-being, Ambience Designer features a variety of background and
environmental sounds such as rain, bird sounds, and subtle wind that are intended to help users
relax during tense or stressful moments. The sounds in the app can be combined in many ways
to create a number of unique sound environments that aim to be conducive to a relaxed mental
state. The app features a sound library that users can search and browse to find sounds to add to
their ambiences. After adding a selection of sounds, the app allows users to fine tune their
ambiences by adjusting individual sound parameters such as volume, or by adjusting the overall
volume of the ambience by adjusting a global volume slider. Ambience Designer also allows
users to load pre-configured ambiences, which users can immediately begin editing without the
need to start creating ambiences from scratch. When a user has finished editing an ambience, he
or she may save the configuration so that it can be loaded at a later time.

Ambience Designer is intended to be used by users who enjoy having subtle environmental
sounds in the background, but may live or work where these sounds are not commonly heard,
such as in urban environments. The app is intended to help users who frequently become
anxious or stressed when engaging in potentially stressful activities such as working or traveling.
The app is also designed for users who wish to have mentally-healing sounds available in one
place without having to search for multiple sources or videos online to hear the same types of
sounds. There are several examples of problems that Ambience Designer could help solve. For
example, users who are more easily distracted by stress may find that the app helps clear their
minds and direct their focus towards their work. The app may also solve problems of
performance anxiety by helping users destress during moments before a performance.
Ambience Designer may also help users who may have trouble falling asleep, by providing
ambient sounds such as white or pink noise that help to block out distracting sounds from the
environment.

All sounds of the app are either public domain sounds sourced from freesound.org and mixkit.co, or produced by me in Logic Pro.
